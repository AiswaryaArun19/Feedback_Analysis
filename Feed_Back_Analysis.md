# Machine Learning Report on Intel Certification Course Participant Segmentation

# 1. Problem Statement

A study of the segmentation of the Intel Certification course participants over satisfaction level.

# 2. Introduction

Feedback analysis is crucial in educational settings for improving instruction quality. Machine learning offers powerful tools to segment feedback into meaningful categories. This study combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and K-means clustering to achieve participant segmentation.
### Dataset
- The dataset encompasses feedback from students across various academic branches and is targeted at different resource persons.
- There is a representation of 4 unique branches and feedback has been recorded for 4 distinct resource persons.
- The distribution of data across faculty members is diverse, reflecting a wide range of feedback for individual sessions. This variety in responses can be instrumental in understanding the multifaceted aspects of teaching and learning experiences.

# 3. Methodology

The methodology involves EDA to summarize data characteristics and identify patterns. K-means clustering, an unsupervised learning method, segments participants based on feedback similarity. The Elbow method aids in determining the optimal number of clusters.

# 4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

## Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

In this Python script, we are leveraging popular data science and visualization libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The key libraries utilized are:

- **NumPy:** A powerful library for numerical operations in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

- **Pandas:** A data manipulation and analysis library, making it easy to work with structured data through its DataFrame object.

- **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library that enhances the aesthetics of plots and provides additional functionality.

- **Matplotlib:** A versatile plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

The `%matplotlib inline` magic command ensures that Matplotlib plots are displayed directly within the Jupyter Notebook or other compatible environments.

Additionally, the `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')` line is included to suppress warning messages, enhancing the overall readability of the output.
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
## Installing Seaborn Using Pip

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. 

```python
pip install seaborn
```

## Reading CSV Data Using `pd.read_csv()`
The following line of code loads data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
df_class = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv")
```
The `pd.read_csv()` code segment plays a pivotal role in this script, making use of the `read_csv` function from the pandas library (`pd`). Below is a breakdown of its significance:

- **pd.read_csv():** This code employs the `read_csv` function, a fundamental tool in the pandas library. It specializes in reading data from CSV files, facilitating the creation of a DataFrameâ€”a tabular data structure widely used in pandas.

- **File Path ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv"):** The function receives a crucial argument, the URL pointing to the CSV file. This URL corresponds to a raw CSV file hosted on GitHub, specifically within the "Intel-Unnati-sessions" repository.

- **df_class = ...:** The outcome of the `pd.read_csv()` operation is assigned to a variable named `df_class`. This variable now holds a DataFrame, essentially representing the content extracted from the CSV file. The choice of the name `df_class` is arbitrary and can be personalized based on user preference.

## Displaying Initial Rows of the DataFrame

The `df_class.head()` line in Python is a DataFrame method used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame stored in the variable `df_class`. 
 `df_class.head()` allows you to view the initial rows of the DataFrame, providing a snapshot of the data and helping you understand its structure and content. This is a common practice in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset before performing further analysis or visualization.
```python
# Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df_class.head())
```

Our initial exploration of the data (EDA) reveals valuable insights into the feedback provided by participants of the Intel Certification course. By employing various data visualization techniques, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the participant experience across different instructors, content areas, and branches.

## Balanced Data Distribution and High Content Quality:

The visualizations depict a well-distributed dataset across instructors, with Mrs. Akshara Sasidharan contributing the largest share of feedback. This distribution allows for a thorough analysis of diverse teaching styles and content delivery methods.

Dominating the visualizations are high ratings for content quality across all resource persons. This positive response affirms that the course material generally meets or even surpasses participant expectations, providing a strong foundation for the learning experience.

## Variability in Session Effectiveness and Organization:

While content quality is consistently praised, variations and outliers are present in the ratings for effectiveness, expertise, and overall organization. These fluctuations suggest that specific sessions may require further investigation. Although certain sessions received high marks, others may warrant additional attention to improve participant satisfaction.

Further analysis reveals that the instructors' expertise is highly regarded, with minimal outliers present. This reinforces the exceptional quality of instruction delivered throughout the course.

## Focus on Relevance and Potential for Improvement:

Participants have assigned high relevance scores, highlighting the curriculum's effectiveness in preparing them to apply their acquired knowledge to real-world scenarios. This strong emphasis on practical application underscores the course's value proposition.

While trending positively, the overall organization of the sessions exhibits slightly more variability compared to other metrics. This variability indicates potential for improvement in time management and clarity of instructions, ensuring smoother and more focused learning experiences in future iterations.

## Branch-Wise Content Quality and Identifying Areas for Enhancement:

A granular analysis by branch reveals generally consistent content quality across all academic programs. However, the ECE branch demonstrates slightly more variability in its ratings. This finding suggests a potential area for focused improvements to ensure consistent learning outcomes across diverse academic disciplines.




# 5.Machine Learning Model to study segmentation: K-means clustering


The Elbow method, a visualization technique, is employed to guide the selection of the optimal number of clusters ('k') for K-means clustering, a machine learning algorithm used to segment data into distinct groups. The visualization displays a smooth decrease in the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) as 'k' increases.

While the initial trend indicates that a 4-cluster solution might be optimal, a detailed analysis of the feedback necessitates the selection of 3 clusters for a more nuanced exploration of participant segmentation.

## Visualizing Clusters for Tailored Interventions:

By employing the chosen 3-cluster K-means model, we can visualize distinct segments within the participant feedback. This segmentation is visualized using the effectiveness and expertise ratings as key features. This distinct grouping of feedback suggests potential variations in participant satisfaction levels or expectations.

The identification of these distinct segments holds significant value for course providers. This information can be leveraged to tailor resources and interventions to address the specific needs and preferences of different participant groups.

# 6.Results and Conclusion:

By effectively combining EDA and K-means clustering, we have gained valuable insights from the participant feedback on the Intel Certification course. The analysis reveals several key takeaways:

## Strengths:

- The course excels in content quality, instructor expertise, and course relevance, ensuring participants gain valuable knowledge applicable to real-world scenarios.

## Areas for Improvement:

- While content is generally strong, opportunities exist to enhance the effectiveness and overall organization of the sessions, fostering a more streamlined and efficient learning experience.

These insights, informed by the segmentation analysis, provide a crucial roadmap for future course iterations. By incorporating targeted improvements in identified areas and tailoring content delivery and organization strategies to address the needs of diverse participant groups, the course can continue to deliver exceptional learning experiences that empower participants to thrive in their respective fields.
