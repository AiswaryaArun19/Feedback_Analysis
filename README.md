# Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

In this Python script, we are leveraging popular data science and visualization libraries for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The key libraries utilized are:

- **NumPy:** A powerful library for numerical operations in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

- **Pandas:** A data manipulation and analysis library, making it easy to work with structured data through its DataFrame object.

- **Seaborn:** Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library that enhances the aesthetics of plots and provides additional functionality.

- **Matplotlib:** A versatile plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

The `%matplotlib inline` magic command ensures that Matplotlib plots are displayed directly within the Jupyter Notebook or other compatible environments.

Additionally, the `warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')` line is included to suppress warning messages, enhancing the overall readability of the output.
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```
# Installing Seaborn Using Pip

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. 

```python
pip install seaborn
```

# Reading CSV Data Using `pd.read_csv()`
The following line of code loads data from a CSV file hosted on GitHub into a pandas DataFrame:

```python
df_class = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv")
```
The `pd.read_csv()` code segment plays a pivotal role in this script, making use of the `read_csv` function from the pandas library (`pd`). Below is a breakdown of its significance:

- **pd.read_csv():** This code employs the `read_csv` function, a fundamental tool in the pandas library. It specializes in reading data from CSV files, facilitating the creation of a DataFrameâ€”a tabular data structure widely used in pandas.

- **File Path ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv"):** The function receives a crucial argument, the URL pointing to the CSV file. This URL corresponds to a raw CSV file hosted on GitHub, specifically within the "Intel-Unnati-sessions" repository.

- **df_class = ...:** The outcome of the `pd.read_csv()` operation is assigned to a variable named `df_class`. This variable now holds a DataFrame, essentially representing the content extracted from the CSV file. The choice of the name `df_class` is arbitrary and can be personalized based on user preference.

# Displaying Initial Rows of the DataFrame

The `df_class.head()` line in Python is a DataFrame method used to display the first few rows of the DataFrame stored in the variable `df_class`. 
 `df_class.head()` allows you to view the initial rows of the DataFrame, providing a snapshot of the data and helping you understand its structure and content. This is a common practice in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset before performing further analysis or visualization.
```python
# Displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df_class.head())
```

# Data Presentation Enhancement: Stylized DataFrame Subset

In our endeavor to improve the visual representation of our dataset, the following line of code has been implemented to stylize a sampled subset of our DataFrame, denoted as `df_class`. The primary goal is to enhance the visual appeal and accessibility of a randomly selected portion of our data for better analysis.

```python
df_class.sample(5).style.set_properties(**{'background-color': 'darkgreen', 'color': 'white', 'border-color': 'darkblack'})
```
